   The Moorhouse collection features photographs taken primarily by Lee Moorhouse from 1880 to 1920. During this time frame, many photographers like Moorhouse believed that Native Americans were being lost to Western European ideals and Native American culture needed to be captured.
   <br>
   <br>
   Lee Moorhouse was best known for his depiction of this culture through his portraits of people predominantly from the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Although he often took photos of tribal members in landscapes near their homes, many of these portraits were taken in his backyard.
   <br>
   <br>
   Moorhouse also gathered Native American artifacts like items of clothing, baskets, or weapons from different tribes and often showcased them at fairs. When passing tribal members posed for portraits, Moorhouse often placed these artifacts in the photo’s frame so that they were captured as well.

        Many college students aim to leave a legacy in the short amount of time they have living as carefree and hopeful as they’ll ever be. For a lucky bunch, their legacy reigns on nearly 40 years after their time at the University of Oregon – this was the class of Animal House.
        <br>
        <br>
        The year was 1978 and a group of bell-bottom blue jean wearing college kids are lounging with their backs against a dusty cherry red Ford Cortina. The sun has gone down but the city of Eugene is alive. Somewhere in the distance the late, great John Belushi can be seen signing autographs for a group of giggling girls. 
        <br>
        <br>
        A compilation of old footage from the filming of Animal House gives the impression that this was one of the most thrilling times the city of Eugene has felt. 
        <br>
        <br>
        “It’s madness, but it’s really exciting madness,” a female student sporting wide-rimmed glasses and some serious bangs says in an interview with a local news station. She is one of many UO students chosen to be an extra in the Hollywood film.
        <br>
        <br>
        The madness continued eight years following the film, when the “Delta Tau Chi” a.k.a. Animal House on E. 11th Street was being demolished. 
        <br>
        <br>
        A bulldozer sits in front of the dumpy white house, shutters dangling and furniture arranged atop the roof. As a mystery man throws a soggy armchair from the second story, the crowd goes wild – students have gathered around, boom-box and beer in hand to commemorate the legendary landmark. 
        <br>
        <br>
        “It’s another reason to get together with the boys [and drink some beer]. But more importantly we’re together here and showing we love fraternities,” a male student says in an interview with KEZI. “[Belushi] would have wanted us to do this – it’s in his memory that we’re out here.” 
        <br>
        <br>
        Although we weren’t able to leave our legacy on the big-screen, we share the pride of having this ever-lasting connection to the iconic film and bask in the familiarity we feel when watching Belushi suck down jello in the Fishbowl, or ROTC members march along Hayward Field. 
        <br>
        <br>
        “It’s a piece of our culture, 50 years from now that movie is going to be history,” a woman said, standing nearby as the ‘Animal House’ was being torn down in 1986. She was right.

    The Burgess Manuscript Collection is an anomaly among the items at Special Collections. Comprised of 64 books, half which date back to the Medieval and Renaissance, are handwritten works of which their donation marked the beginning of the rare book collection at the University and Special Collections itself. 
    <br>
    <br>
    “The fact that we actually have full works, in their entirety, in this form, is pretty unusual,” Bruce Tabb, Special Collections Librarian and expert on the Burgess Collection.
    <br>
    <br>
    The books were donated and sold to the University thought the late 30’s by Julian Burgess after her brother and original owner of the collection died. The Burgess Collection is actually comprised of three separate collections, the Burgess Rarebook, Manuscript, and Family Papers collection. 
    <br>
    <p id="pull">
    “The fact that we have thirty-five books in their entirety is pretty special” Bruce Tabb
    </p>
    Some of the books include a commentary on the numbering system of the Bible, a book on sexuality and marriage, and a history of the Roman Empire that was written in the middle ages. One of the more unique pieces is a medieval textbook where the writing of a student is present. Drawings of hands can be seen that were used to highlight certain passages, way before highlight markers were invented.
    <br>
    <br>
    The pieces are mostly written on vellum, or animal skin. In some cases holes occurred in the sheets through natural stretching, thus causing it to have to be sown up or written around. This causes issues with scanning and leads many scholars seek out the original text.
    <br>
    <br>
    One of the bibles is suspected of being written on the skin of either newly or unborn calf as it is extremely soft. The ink is acidic and some case has eaten through the page. The majority of the books are handwritten with a few having been made by a wood block printing press.
    <br>
    <br>
    It’s rare to see such a large volume of complete manuscripts, as it is common practice for book dealers to cut them up and sell the books page by page to make more money. In some cases they will cut out the art work or sell the page in pieces.
    <br>
    <br>
    “The fact that we have thirty-five books in their entirety is pretty special,” said Tabb.
    <br>
    <br>
    They books were painstaking to make, where only eight to ten pages were written a day. The team of writers and artist could only work during the day, or when the light allowed it, and had to be young of age in order to work a steady hand for precise writing. The writing is uniform and appears as though a machine or printing press wrote instead of a person.
    <br>
    <br>
    Only those who were rich or members of the church could own such an expensive luxury. And having them bound even more so as they were created without one. Just a packet of papers was the norm until the trend of bookbinding most recently came along in the past couple hundred years. 
    <br>
    <br>
    “The thing to remember is that these things are quite valuable, but they were valuable in their day, said Tabb.
    <br>
    <br>
    A lot of the writing in the manuscripts was abbreviated. Similar to how people today shortening things to LOL and OMG with texting. The writings come in a variety of languages including: English, Latin, Persian, and Church Slavonic.
    <br>
    <br>
    In addition to the writing, there are many examples of beautiful artwork on the manuscripts that were handmade and put on gold leaf. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The books are mainly used today by scholars researching medieval literature or students looking for examples of medieval artwork. Any one is free to check out one of these texts and hold a nearly thousand year old book.
